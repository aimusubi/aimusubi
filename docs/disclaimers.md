Vendor Platform & Lab Image Disclaimer

AIMusubi interacts with network operating systems using public APIs such as RESTCONF, NETCONF/YANG, gNMI, and vendor-published JSON/XML RPC interfaces. All integrations rely exclusively on open, standards-based, or publicly documented protocols.

AIMusubi does not redistribute, bundle, or provide access to any vendor software images (including but not limited to Cisco IOS-XE, Arista EOS, or VyOS).
Users must supply their own legally licensed software images from the appropriate vendors or distributions.

All vendor names, platforms, and trademarks belong to their respective owners. AIMusubi is an independent open-source project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any vendor.

This project is intended solely for learning, research, and homelab exploration. It is not intended for production use without appropriate licensing and vendor approval.
